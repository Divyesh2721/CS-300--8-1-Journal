# CS-300--8-1-Journal

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this class, we learned how to solve problems in a step-by-step way and how those steps can make things happen faster or slower.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Think about why it's important to know about data structures. I already knew how to do the first 2 algorithms, 
so I just read what I needed to do and did it well. I had to look in the book and watch videos to understand how 
to make the last part of the binary tree work.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The only problems I had were understanding the binary tree and the big O notation. I watched some videos 
on YouTube and read the book to understand the topic better. Finally, I was able to figure it out and make it work.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project helped me improve my software design skills by learning how to write pseudocode and discovering a 
new algorithm. I also learned how different algorithms can affect the speed of a program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think I'm good at writing clear code,
Rephrase, but this project also improved my ability to write pseudocode.
